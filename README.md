# climo-analysis

Intro:
These files are a means of utilizing the R program that I wrote to find any significant climotological information about a location. This README.md file will tell someone how to change the files to use them for other locations.

The files:
There are three files:
- climo-analysis.Rmd
- analysis-Plots.R
- analysis-Rcode.R

These three files are run in R Studio, and constitute the innerworkings of how to create this r-pubs page: https://rpubs.com/hurleya/climateAnalysis

Structure:
The R Markdown (Rmd) file is run, which calls the other two files.

Data:
The scripts are pre-programmed to recognize some specific column titles for data. Additionally, they are programmed to recognize specific column numbers. You can tweak this within the analysis-Rcode.R file to adjust which columns you want to analyze.
